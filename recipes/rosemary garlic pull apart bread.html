        <p>Starting from a simple rosemary-infused homemade dough, this <strong>rosemary garlic pull apart bread</strong> is shaped and assembled with butter, garlic, cheese, and herbs. 
            Baked until golden brown and served pull-apart style, this flaky and flavorful bread is completely irresistible. Just wait until you smell it baking! 
            Truly a favorite.

            <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter <em>softened to room temperature</em></li>

            <li>2 and 1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp finely chopped rosemary</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Filling</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>5 tbsp unsalted butter, extra soft</li>
            <li>1 tbsp finely choppped fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>1 tbsp finely chopped parsley</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced or 1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup shredded parmesan, mozzarella, or white cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong>Place the yeast and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. 
                Or, if you do not own a stand mixer, a regular large mixing bowl. 
                Heat the milk on the stove or in the microwave until warm to touch, about 110°F (43°C). 
                Pour warm milk on top of yeast/sugar. Whisk gently to combine, then loosely cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow to sit for 5-10 minutes. 
                The mixture will be frothy after 5-10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>If you do not have a mixer, you can mix the dough together with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in this step. 
                Add the butter, egg, flour, salt, garlic powder, and rosemary. 
                Beat on low speed for 3 minutes. Dough will be soft. 
                Transfer it to a lightly floured work surface. 
                Using lightly floured hands, knead it for 1 minute. 
                If the dough is too sticky to handle, add 1-3 more Tablespoons of flour, but you want a very soft dough. 
                Shape into a ball.
            </li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl (I use nonstick spray to grease) and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. 
                Place in a slightly warm environment to rise until doubled in size, around 60-90 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                As the dough rises, prepare the filling in the next step and grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Make the filling:</strong> In a medium bowl, mix the soft butter, rosemary, parsley, garlic, and salt together. 
                 the butter is soft enough, you can just mix it all together with a spoon or fork. 
                 You can use an electric mixer if that’s easier too. Cover tightly and set aside until ready to use. 
                 (Don’t refrigerate unless making well in advance. It’s easiest to spread on the dough when at room temperature. 
                If refrigerated, let it come to room temperature before spreading on dough pieces.)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Assemble the bread:</strong> Punch down the dough to release the air. 
                Place dough on a lightly floured work surface. 
                Divide it into 12 equal pieces, each about 1/4 cup of dough and a little larger than a golf ball. 
                Using lightly floured hands, flatten each into a circle that’s about 4 inches in diameter. 
                The circle doesn’t have to be perfectly round. 
                I do not use a rolling pan to flatten, but you certainly can if you want. 
                Spread 1-2 teaspoons of filling mixture onto each. 
                Sprinkle each with 1 Tablespoon of cheese. 
                Fold circles in half and line in prepared baking pan, round side up. 
                See photos above for a visual.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rise once again in a slightly warm environment until puffy, about 45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position then preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake until golden brown, about 50 minutes. 
                If you find the top of the loaf is browning too quickly, tent with aluminum foil. 
                (Don’t be alarmed if there’s melted butter around the sides of the bread as it bakes, it will seep into the bread before it finishes.) 
                Remove from the oven and place the pan on a wire rack. 
                If desired, brush with melted butter for topping and sprinkle with sea salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then remove from the pan and serve warm.
            </li>
            <li>Cover and store leftovers at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. 
                Since the bread is extra crispy on the exterior, it will become a little hard after day 1. 
                Reheat in a 300°F (149°C) oven for 10-15 minutes until interior is soft again or warm in the microwave.
